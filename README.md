# A-Algorithm
Your objective is to implement the A* pathfinding algorithm and to use it to find paths in a pathfinding graph that is input to the program.

Project should run if you download the main python file as well as the Graph AB connections and AB nodes so that the program can look through each file and run the contents through the A* algorithm.

This project was created to understand the A* algorithm, how it works, what it does. We learned Dijkstra's right next to it, however, we didn't do anything with Dijkstra's algorithm. Both are graph finding / path finding
algorithms that are used mostly in AI game development. A* is a traversal path finding algorithm, it needs a weighted graph, a source node and an end node in order to find the optimal path. 

If you're learning about these types of graph algorithms in an algorithms or AI class, this project may help you visualize how the A* works on a set of Nodes and Connection points.
